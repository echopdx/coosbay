## Kayaking & Paddleboarding

Getting out on the water in a self-propelled vessel is to truly connect to the surroundings. With a number of lakes, rivers, ocean bays, and estuaries, Oregon's south coast offers kayakers and paddleboarders of all skill levels with an abundance of options. For example, take a guided tour of the {{< link url="https://www.oregon.gov/dsl/SS/Pages/About.aspx" >}}South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve{{< /link >}}, a protected area of land and estuary. Guided tours are offered by the Slough staff and [local tour guides](/tour-guides-and-charters). There are a variety of birds that utilize this beautiful area including Bald Eagles, Osprey, Great Blue Herons, Egrets and Belted Kingfishers. The tides are great in this estuary so we will plan to ride the ebbing and flowing tides to make this paddle a little easier.  

Paddle down the Coquille River, in Sunset Bay, or in Coos Bay. For an extra adventure, bring your fishing gear and try your hand at [kayak fishing](/tripideas/kayak-fishing-on-the-south-coast)!

## Surfing on Oregon's Adventure Coast

We'd love to be able to say, "come on in, the water's fine" but it would be more like "come on in, the water's fine, but cold, so wear a wetsuit"! Join your fellow surfers at one of the finest, most exhilarating surfing spots along the South Coast, {{< link url="http://www.co.coos.or.us/Departments/CoosCountyParks/Bastendorff.aspx" >}}Bastendorf Beach{{< /link >}} in Charleston. Bastendorff Beach is a favorite among surfers, kiters, beachcombers - locals and tourists alike. Youâ€™ll find an uncrowded beach and spectacular ocean views.

Here's a great video to give you some hints about Bastendorff Beach!
