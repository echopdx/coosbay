## Grocery Stores & To-Go Dining for Your Oregon Coast Vacation

If you want to get it to go, the delis and grocery stores throughout Coos Bay, North Bend, and Charleston will let you pick the ingredients for that picnic or camp out, or you can take them back to make a meal at your accommodations that feature kitchen amenities. 

Eat well, you’re going to need your energy.
