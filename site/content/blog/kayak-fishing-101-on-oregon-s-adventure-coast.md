"Many go fishing all their lives without knowing that it is not fish they are after." - Henry David Thoreau

Kayak fishing is more popular than ever on Oregon’s South Coast, and with the 10th Annual Sunset Bay Angler Of The Day Kayak Fishing Challenge coming up August 24th, we thought this would the perfect time to share some answers to commonly asked questions about kayak fishing on Oregon’s Adventure Coast. 

What’s so special about kayak fishing, you may ask? Many people will say that they are drawn to this growing watersport for the purpose of ease and simplicity. You are not required to buy or rent expensive equipment and the sport is accessible to anglers of all skill levels. “Most fishing kayaks will float in 6" of water while holding up to 350 pounds of cargo,” writes Jerry White in Why Fish From a Kayak. “Not only does that make it easier to get on the water, but usually these places aren't accessible to conventional boats, either by law (designated as a "No Motor Zone") or by nature itself. .   

In addition to being more accessible, kayak fishing offers serenity and unsurpassed views of natural habitats and scenery that can only be found deep in the lakes, rivers and open water along the Pacific coastline. 

Where Can I Rent Kayaks and Fishing Gear? 
Unless you’re BYOY (bring your own yak) you’ll need to rent one from one of our local businesses. Waxer’s Surf Shop in Coos Bay is a great place to rent a quality kayak and other sports gear and equipment from helpful, knowledgeable staff members.  
South Coast Tours (SCT), one of Oregon’s premier guided tour companies is now partnering with Oregon State Parks to offer kayaking rental packages right on Sunset Bay State Park between 10am-4pm on weekends. 
The newly opened Bahama Boards in Coos Bay is another solid local resources to rent kayaks (or purchase) in addition to the gear, clothing, and accessories you may need as you explore the Pacific ocean waters, lakes and rivers!  
Canoas Bay Bridge Rentals in North Bend also offers kayak rentals and other fishing necessities. For added convenience, you can also book a room at their Bay Bridge Motel! (I didn’t know about this place! Will add it to our list of businesses for equipment rental)

**An Oregon fishing license is required for those age 12 years or older. Daily licenses are available. Most fishing charters, bait shops and sporting goods stores can supply these for you. Check out our fishing license requirement page for where to buy a licenses and bait. You can also find a list of local businesses that can help by clicking here. 

Where are the best places in our area to do kayak fishing? 
Sunset Bay State Park is a local favorite among kayakers. Known for its calm waters and easy access to the beach, Sunset Bay State Park is an ideal location for kayak anglers who want to head offshore into the ocean in search of cabezon, lingcod, and halibut. 
The calm waters in nearby Woahink, Siltcoos or Ten Mile lakes are best for bass, trout and perch. (NOTE: Ten Mile lake is under a ban right now – no swimming or skiing because of bacteria levels, maybe switch this for Lake Marie or Saunders)
The Umpqua, Coos or Coquille rivers are ideal destinations for kayakers who are searching for chinook salmon.  

When is the best time to go? 
Depending on the weather forecast, anglers of all skill levels can easily access the lakes and rivers and ocean waters (via Sunset Bay State Park) on Oregon’s South Coast any time of the year. When you go also depends on what species of fish you’re after. Download our Fishing Information Rack Card here (PDF). We strongly recommend checking current fishing conditions and requirements by going to Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife’s website. Visitors will also find excellent tips and recommendations by calling local businesses like Basin Tackle Shop and Bite’s On Bait & Tackle. Here’s a list of other recommended businesses that can offer helpful tips, equipment and gear. 

It’s no surprise that the abundance of calm lakes, rivers and beaches on Oregon’s South Coast make this area a prime destination for kayak fishing.
