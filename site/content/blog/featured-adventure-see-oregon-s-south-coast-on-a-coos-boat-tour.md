"We went on a two hour tour and the boat ride was very smooth and excellent. The Captain and the Shipmate are truly friendly and down to earth people with a great sense of humor. The captain followed the tall pirate ships as they fired there cannons and stayed close to the pirate ship and we were able to take excellent pictures and video. Thank you for making this a wonderful memory for our family from Chicago & Cottage Grove." - Tammy A. Facebook
