  While the rest of the country was shivering with record temperatures and
  snowstorms this winter, Mother Nature treated us to a number of balmy 60
  degree days and sunshine here on the Southern Oregon coast. We also had plenty
  of days to watch the spectacular waves as a result of the winter storms coming
  ashore off the mighty Pacific, but overall, it was a very pleasant winter.

**UPDATED with 2018 Dates!**

While the rest of the country was shivering with record temperatures and snowstorms this winter, Mother Nature treated us to a number of balmy 60 degree days and sunshine here on the Southern Oregon coast. We also had plenty of days to watch the spectacular waves as a result of the winter storms coming ashore off the mighty Pacific, but overall, it was a very pleasant winter.

The warmer temperatures are a reminder that the glorious gardens in <a href="http://shoreacres.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shore Acres State Park</a> will soon be in full bloom.  What began as a luxurious private estate that belonged to lumber and shipping tycoon, Louis Simpson, has become a beloved local treasure featuring a “garden for all seasons” for anyone to enjoy.

The original plantings of Shore Acres were designed to take advantage of our mild climate and featured exotic trees, shrubs, and flowering plants brought in from around the world by Simpson. The grounds contained five acres of formal gardens, including a Japanese-style garden built around a 100-foot lily pond to compliment Mr. Simpson&#8217;s elaborate home featuring a heated, indoor swimming pool and a large ballroom.

In 1942, Simpson’s beloved Shore Acres was purchased by the state of Oregon for use as a public park. Thanks to the help of thousands of Friends of Shore Acres volunteers, visitors can expect to see hundreds of rhododendrons, azaleas, daffodils along with thousands of tulips this spring. The garden also features thousands of flowering annuals/perennials and rose bushes through the summer along with dahlias in the fall. And visitors can of course enjoy 300,000 or more holiday lights (almost all L.E.D.) during the holidays.

Here are some notable dates coming up!
