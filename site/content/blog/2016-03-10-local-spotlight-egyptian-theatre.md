### **Did You Say 1925?!**

That&#8217;s right, it first started back in 1925 right in the heart of downtown Coos Bay. But did you know it wasn&#8217;t always a theatre? In 1922 the space was originally constructed as the Motor Inn Garage and Service station but it was meant to be, however, as it was right around this moment that a major historical event transpired: King Tutankhamen’s tomb was unearthed.

The American public was fascinated by the allure and mysteries of ancient Egypt, leading to an adoption of what is now known as Egyptian Revival style. The Motor Inn Garage and Service Station was shut down due to building restrictions and the space took on a new form: The Egyptian Theatre.

The Theatre has changed ownership throughout the years, finally being purchased by The City of Coos Bay Urban Renewal Agency in 2006. With the enlisted help of nonprofit <a href="http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com/membership-info/" target="_blank">Egyptian Theatre Preservation Association</a>, they have transformed the venue into a showcase for classic and educational movies, hosted concerts, special events, and community celebrations.

This theatre was recently featured on <a href="http://kcby.com/features/western-oregon-living" target="_blank">KCBY&#8217;s Western Oregon Living</a>. Take a look-

### **So You&#8217;re Saying People Like This Place?**

That&#8217;s putting it lightly! Here are just a couple of reviews from the Egyptian Theatre&#8217;s [Tripadvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g51813-d7227989-Reviews-Egyptian_Theater-Coos_Bay_Oregon.html#REVIEWS) page:

_&#8220;Have come to over 10 performances here in the last several years. A truly jaw dropping interior that is one of a kind, and really brings back the spirit of the roaring 20&#8217;s. Visit if you have a chance!__&#8220;_

_&#8220;__I absolutely love the movies we see there. We saw the Minions recently. We also saw the old Mummy with Boris Karloff. The popcorn is fabulous. The seats are comfortable and you can see from every seat. We will keep going back.__&#8220;_

_&#8220;__I love this place and so nice to see it alive. Have enjoyed many of the things going on, a nice place to spend an evening out. Terrific job by those who run it and those who put it all together.__&#8220;_

_&#8220;__This is like a trip back in time. The decor is original, and the feel reminds me of going to the movies back when I was a kid. A definite classic experience. Seats are very comfortable, great snack bar, clean restrooms!__&#8220;_
