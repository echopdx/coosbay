Break out those dancin’ shoes! The annual <a href="https://clambakejazz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">South Coast Clambake Music Festival </a> (formerly South Coast Clambake Jazz Festival) is coming back to rock and roll Oregon's South Coast <strong>March 9th-11th, 2018</strong>!



This year's exciting musical extravaganza brings another fabulous lineup of incredible music that ranges from traditional jazz to 50’s rock, including swing, doo-wop, blues, big band and Zydeco!



What originally began as the Dixieland Jazz Festival nearly 30 years ago has evolved into one of the biggest annual music festivals on the Oregon Coast and offers a wide range of musical styles that will have you up on your feet.



If this is your first Clambake Music Festival, don't let “Clambake” in the title throw you off! “Clambake” is actually an old-time musical term for a “jam session”. The festival is a celebration of music and attracts music enthusiasts and dance lovers from up and down the West Coast. But don't worry, there are plenty of spots around town serving fresh clams and you can even dig your own!



The South Coast Clambake Music Festival is one of the biggest musical events of the year, so be sure to make your reservations as soon as you can! <a href="http://oregonsadventurecoast.com/lodging/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Click here</strong> </a>to see our list of hotel, motel and bed &amp; breakfast properties throughout the area.
