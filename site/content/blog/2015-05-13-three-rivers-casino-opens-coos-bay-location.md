Former tribal council chair Bob Garcia says he envisioned the business as just the beginning of better things to come in the Empire area. &#8220;What I see this as is the first step in the revitalization of Empire,&#8221; he recently told <a href="http://theworldlink.com/news/local/business/three-rivers-casino-coos-bay-to-open-may/article_41513331-ce0f-5463-a583-7635f80b0118.html" target="_blank">The World Newspaper</a>. &#8220;We want to make investments in the area and see things improve.&#8221;

“Our investment in this facility reflects the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians’ long-term commitment to the local southern Oregon coast community,&#8221; said Garcia in an announcement of the opening event. &#8220;We believe in this community and we want to build and maintain a positive partnership with everyone here.”
