Fresh and delicious Coos Bay oysters have been an Oregon Coast delicacy for generations, and everyone seems to have an opinion on the best way to enjoy them. Whether it ’s roasted, fried, sauteed, steamed open on the barbecue, broiled or served raw, guess you could say the the world is your oyster when you are here on Oregon's Adventure Coast. 

The 14th annual Charleston “Ahh Shucks!” Oyster Feed, our annual celebration of fresh oysters, is coming up April 27th which got us thinking about where to find the very best oysters in the Coos Bay/North Bend/Charleston area? We asked around an here’s what we found out.  

Ah Shucks! 14th Annual Charleston Oyster Feed
If you are an oyster lover, the Ah Shucks! 14th Annual Charleston Oyster Feed is the place you need to be on April 27th.  This is a prime opportunity to taste delicious, fresh-from-Coos-Bay oysters provided by several of our local growers. 

Oysters will be prepared in a variety of ways and will be served with dipping sauces, baked beans, coleslaw, garlic bread and a choice of beverages. Not a fan of oysters? No problem, there will also be options for you too. The event will also include live music, wine and plenty of fun. 

Local Growers
If you can’t make it to this year’s oyster feed, not to worry. Some of the best oysters on the planet are harvested by local growers year round. Some of our finest local growers include http://www.clausenoysters.com/ Clausen's Silverpoint Oyster Co.,   https://www.facebook.com/ClausenOysters/ the largest oyster farm in the State of Oregon. Clausen's is consistently recommended by locals for their resh and shucked oysters as well as smoked oysters, BBQ Garlic-Parmesan Butter Oysters, Chowder and other delicious selections. Stop in to pick up fresh oysters to take home or stick around and enjoy a meal in their new deli/restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating. You cannot miss their signs when you are driving North or South on Highway 101, North of North Bend and North of McCullough Bridge. 

Another local oyster grower to put on your radar is Qualman Oyster Farms in Coos Bay. One of the original oyster farms on Oregon’s Adventure Coast, Qualman’s grows their oysters in the South Slough sanctuary in immaculate and pristine conditions. Fans of Qualman’s say that they have the best oysters due to the quality of the water at the sanctuary which gives them an almost sweeter taste than oysters harvested from the bay.
 
All oysters are all hand grown, handpicked, local and reasonably priced. Qualman Oyster Farms is located at 63218 Troller Rd in Coos Bay. If you’re heading to Charleston on Cape Arago Highway, make a left just before the bridge. https://www.yelp.com/biz/qualman-oyster-farms-coos-ba Port of Coos Bay Article- https://www.portofcoosbay.com/new-room/2016/5/11/from-the-source-qualman-oyster-farms
