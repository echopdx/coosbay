## ‘Crack Up’ fresh Oregon Dungeness Crab from Charleston at the North Bend Community Center on Saturday, February 9th!

Better bring your appetite to Oregon's Adventure Coast the weekend of February 9th because The Charleston fishing village is bringing Oregon’s fresh Dungeness crab harvest to YOU at the [35th Annual Charleston Merchants Crab Feed ]()this year.

The event will be from 11 AM to 3 PM at the North Bend Community Center, 2222 Broadway Ave in North Bend, OR 97459. This is the main fundraising event for the Charleston Visitors Center, but also provides funding to other needs in the Charleston community.

In honor of the occasion,  our friends at the Port of Coos Bay have created this guide to Crabbing in Charleston along with a delicious recipe for Crab Souffle developed by Margie Whitmer of The Wild Women of Charleston, OR.

“The Oregon Dungeness Commercial Crab fishery is made up of men and women from coastal towns like Charleston, who care about good food and good crabbing,” says Tim Novotny, Oregon Dungeness Crab Commission, “The Charleston fleet is proud to contribute to its community in a variety of ways. Last year, they did so in the biggest of ways, by helping to bring in over $16 million dollars to the local economy through the Oregon Dungeness crab fishery. They also love to see people flock to events like this, because it helps to draw people to the restaurants and storefronts around Charleston – contributing even more to the local economy – while also enjoying the fruits of their hard work at the same time. Some come on down and have some fun in Charleston! We know you can’t help but crack a smile when you crack into our locally caught Oregon Dungeness crab.”

Volunteers will serve whole or half fresh crab dinners with side dishes, rolls, and a beverage. Whole crab dinners are $20 and half crab dinners at $16 but prices are subject to the markets. Make sure to leave room for dessert as pies and cakes will be available for sale by the Ladies Garden Club for $1 per slice. Beer and wine will be available and served by the Charleston’s Miller’s Sports Bar & Grill. There will also be crab bibs, vendor coupons and prize drawings during the festival!

Make a weekend of it! Head out to Charleston and learn about marine life at the Charleston Marine Life Center, go crabbing off the docks at the Charleston Marina Shore, stormwatch at Shore Acres, Sunset Bay and Cape Arago State Parks, and hike the trails at South Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve. All are popular recreation spots just minutes away!

Local Key Club students and Chamber Ambassadors along with other volunteers will be serving and making your Dungeness crab dinner a great and fun experience! “The returning star of the annual festival is fresh, certifiably delicious Oregon Dungeness crab,” said Wild Woman Mel Campbell. “Don’t miss it!”
