### ✔ Layered Clothing

It&#8217;s best to assume fluctuating weather; anticipate cold weather when making an early morning departure, but be prepared for direct sunlight once the sun comes out. It&#8217;s also important to remember that even the warmest of days can experience a big drop in temperature when offshore. Layered clothing allows you to adjust for changes in temperature accordingly. Be sure that part of your layer clothing includes a waterproof jacket and rain pants.

### ✔ Gloves

Not only will gloves protect you from both sunburn and cold temperatures associated with the previous tip, they will protect you from line cuts.

### ✔ A Hat

A hat is paramount when sitting out on the water in the direct sunlight. Be sure to bring a wide brimmed hat, a baseball hat, or anything else that will provide some shade. Additionally, a hat can help keep you warm on those cold days.
