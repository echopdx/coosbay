## Feast on Fresh Oregon Dungeness Crab on Oregon's Adventure Coast!

Feasting on fresh Oregon Dungeness Crab is an experience every foodie must have while visiting the Oregon Coast. Better yet, why not catch your own? Anyone can go crabbing, no matter what your skill level is! Our local crabbing experts are always happy to help point you in the right direction.

If you're planning a road trip to Oregon's South Coast the weekend of February 9th, 2019 you better bring your appetite because the 35th Annual Charleston Merchants Crab Feed is happening! This beloved annual event will be from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the North Bend Community Center.

In honor of the occasion, we wanted to share some crabbing tips we have collected through years from local experts along with this fantastic infographic and delicious local crab recipe our friends at The Port of Coos Bay shared with us.

### WHEN SHOULD I GO?

The general rule of thumb if you wanna go crabbing is do it in a month with an ‘r’ (January, February, March, etc). 

* Slack water (the time around high or low tide) are the best times to crab. During slack water, crabs are generally walking around and foraging since they are not getting pushed around by tidal exchange. 

### WHAT SHOULD I BRING?

Make sure you have the following supplies before you head out along with the other items listed in the infographic.

* Shellfish license (Ages 12 and older require a shellfish license for crabbing) Crab measuring tool
* Pots or rings (can be rented)
* Cooler
* Gloves
* Bait holders and bait supply 

Rental crab rings are available at many RV parks and other lodging facilities, and tackle and marine supply stores.
