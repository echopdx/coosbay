**Works from Coos Art Museum&#8217;s Permanent Collection: People and Prints**

The museum is currently featuring a large exhibition of selected works from its Permanent Collection through February 4, 2017.  “Permanent Collection: People and Prints” focuses on two areas within Coos Art Museum’s Permanent Collection – portraits and figures, and fine art prints.

Many newly acquired works will be on display for the first time at the Museum and this will be an opportunity to savor the breadth of the Permanent Collection which now includes over 595 works. Many of the works are by well-known local artists such as Gan Martin, while others are by artists with an international reputation such as the Englishmen Henry Moore and Lynn Chadwick.

Coos Art Museum’s fine art print collection is broad containing styles from abstract works such as “Constellations” by the New York artist Howardena Pindell to an Art Nouveau inspired figure by the Czech artist Dagmar Mezricky.

**Internationally known artist Robert Kipniss is featured at Coos Art Museum**
  
The Coos Art Museum is hosting a solo exhibition by the internationally acclaimed fine art printmaker Robert Kipniss through February 4, 2017.  The exhibition takes place in the Museum’s Perkins Gallery and features prints in three different media, dry point, lithography and mezzotint. The exhibition also includes examples of the artist’s preliminary drawings and the copper printing plates.

**Low Tide Landscapes Photos Exhibition**

The Museum is also hosting Low Tide Landscapes, a juried exhibit of images by members of the Willamette Valley PhotoArts Guild, through February 11, 2017. Juror Julia Bradshaw, associate professor of art at Oregon State University, selected photographs by 15 members of the group to make up the exhibit, which explores the unusual and often alien terrain that is exposed along the Oregon Coast during low tides, particularly during extreme minus tides that occur in the spring and summer. Each of the photographers in the show has his or her own photographic style and work in a wide range of photographic media, including pinhole, iPhone, infrared, aerial and platinum, as well as straight and manipulated digital photography.
