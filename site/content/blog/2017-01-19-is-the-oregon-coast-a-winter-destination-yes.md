### An Oregon Coast winter is sometimes warm, sometimes wet, but always wild and wonderful.

One of the draws of the Oregon Coast is its wild unpredictability. There is never a dull day when you live near the mighty Pacific ocean.

You may surprised to learn that winter on the Oregon Coast is actually a lot more pleasant than most people realize. Despite what you may hear about cold and rainy Oregon winters, it&#8217;s not uncommon for coastal residents and visitors to be treated to spectacular balmy days of sunshine. In fact, if you&#8217;re visiting during the winter months, it might be wise to pack some lighter gear and even shorts!

&#8220;Weather statistics bring out the truth, and it’s stranger than fiction,&#8221; it says in this <a href="http://www.beachconnection.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oregon Coast Beach Connection </a>article, _<a href="http://www.beachconnection.net/news/wintw111007_738.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth About Oregon Coast Winter Weather</a>_. &#8220;There’s often more than a sprinkling of blue skies and nice vibes in the winter than you’re probably aware of. On top of it all, meteorologists will admit you don’t get the full picture when it comes to coastal forecasts, and there is even a kind of secret miniature summer tucked away near the end of winter&#8221;.

<a href="http://traveloregon.com/author/eforsha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Travel Oregon&#8217;s Emily Forsha</a> says winter is her favorite season on the Oregon Coast. &#8220;You might find yourself cozying up by a fireplace, watching angry waves crash during a spectacular storm; or you may find yourself on an uncrowded beach on a clear, sunny day that ends with a sunset over a beach bonfire,&#8221; she writes in her post, _<a href="http://traveloregon.com/trip-ideas/oregon-stories/the-oregon-coast-a-winter-odyssey/%20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Oregon Coast, A Winter Odyssey</a>_.

This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lghug7I3qs4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 video</a> (featuring a very cool scene from <a href="http://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&parkId=68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shore Acres State Park</a>) invites you to &#8220;take an awe-inspiring winter odyssey along all 363 miles of Oregon’s public coast where waves thunder onto the shore, crabbing is at its peak, and a rainbow welcomes the calm after the storm&#8221;. Enjoy!
