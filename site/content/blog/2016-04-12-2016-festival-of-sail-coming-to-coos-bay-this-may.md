The brig **<a href="http://www.historicalseaport.org/lady-washington" target="_blank">Lady Washington</a>** and her companion ship **<a href="http://www.historicalseaport.org/hawaiian-chieftain" target="_blank">Hawaiian Chieftain</a>** will return to the <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/listings/coos-bay-boardwalk/" target="_blank">Coos Bay Boardwalk</a> in conjunction with the annual **Festival of Sail** happening May 6-15, 2016.

Numerous events related to the festival are being planned by the <a href="http://coosbaydowntown.org/" target="_blank">Coos Bay Downtown Association</a> and the <a href="https://coosbayboats.org/" target="_blank">Coos Bay Boat Building Center</a>.

Lady Washington is a 1989 wooden replica of one of the first U.S.-flagged vessels to visit the west coast of North America. The modern ship appeared as HMS Interceptor in the movie _Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl_. Hawaiian Chieftain is a steel-hulled representation of a typical early 19th century South Seas trader. She accompanies Lady Washington on her educational voyages. The ships will tie up on the waterfront near 200 S. Bayshore Drive (directly across from the **<a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/" target="_blank">Coos Bay Visitor Center</a>**).

The 2016 Festival of Sail will kick off on Friday, May 6th with a special &#8220;Dress Like a Pirate&#8221; themed <a href="/listings/downtown-coos-bay-wine-walk-8/" target="_blank">Wine Walk</a> in Downtown Coos Bay 5:00 p.m.-7:30 p.m. followed by a 7:45 p.m. showing of _Pirates of the Caribbean_ at the <a href="/2016/03/local-spotlight-egyptian-theatre/" target="_blank">Egyptian Theatre</a>.

Dockside Tours, Battle Sails (featured in the video below), and Evening Sails are happening throughout the festival in addition to many other events including the <a href="https://coosbayboats.org/" target="_blank">Coos Bay Boat Building Center </a>Open House in Empire, <a href="https://southcoastfolksociety.wordpress.com/south-coast-celtic-fest/" target="_blank">South Coast Celtic Fest</a> at Southwestern Oregon Community College, a GeoCache Event, a Treasure Hunt, the “Oh Ship!” Pub Crawl and much much more.

Educators are encouraged to check out the new school programs available. Not only are these programs aligned with Common Core State Standards, they are the most dynamic and hands/on learning experiences available on the west coast!
