Here are some crabbing tips we have collected through years from local experts for you to follow:

### WHEN SHOULD I GO?

* The general rule of thumb if you wanna go crabbing is do it in a month with an ‘r’ (January, February, March, etc).
* Slack water (the time around high or low tide) are the best times to crab. During slack water, crabs are generally walking around and foraging since they are not getting pushed around by tidal exchange.

### WHAT SHOULD I BRING?

Make sure you have the following supplies before you head out:

* Shellfish license (Ages 14 and older require a shellfish license for crabbing)
* Crab measuring tool
* pots or rings (can be rented)
* Cooler
* Gloves
* Bait holders and bait supply

Rental crab rings are available at many RV parks and other lodging facilities, and tackle and marine supply stores. Here are a couple of suggestions to get you started:

* <a href="http://www.fishermenswharforegon.com" target="_blank">Fishermen’s Wharf </a> located on D-Dock in the Charleston Boat Basin. Call for hours of operation (541) 888-TUNA (8862).
* Crab Shack: 63840 Crossline Road, Charleston, OR 97420 (541) 888-3433
* Davey Jones Locker: Cape Arago Highway & Boat Basin Road Charleston, OR 97420

  (541) 888-3941

### WHAT KIND OF BAIT DO I USE?

* If you’re <a href="http://www.fishingcoosbay.com/crabbing.htm" target="_blank">dock crabbing</a>, and have a cage type crab, you can use any kind of bait you want, fish heads do well in attracting the little guys.
* If you’re using the crab ring use chicken or turkey. Fish heads attract seals and sea lions- which you don’t want as they’ll steal your bait.

### WHAT IF I DON’T WANT TO GO CRABBING?

Anyone can go crabbing, no matter what your skill level is! Our local crabbing experts are always happy to help point you in the right direction. However, IF crabbing is not for you, find fresh, locally priced crab inside our <a href="/2014/10/where-to-find-the-freshest-seafood-on-oregons-adventure-coast/" target="_blank">fresh seafood markets</a>. There are some great ones to choose from! Some of the stores will even cook it and clean your crab for you for just 50 cents a crab!

### ANY OTHER TIPS I SHOULD KNOW ABOUT?

* If you wanna check the conditions for the day, you can give **Davey Jones Locker** in Charleston a call at any time: at (541) 888-3941. They’re a tiny little market in that always seems to have whatever you need; if you need a tomato, a shellfish license, a micro-brew beer, and a spatula, you will find it here. They also make a mean clam chowder and have the best dang meatloaf sandwich you’ll ever have!
* Check all lines on pots or rings for knots or kinks to ensure they are durable and will allow gear to work correctly.
* Make sure your pots are properly marked.
* Check with the <a href="http://www.dfw.state.or.us/" target="_blank">Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife</a> for the most current shellfish regulations and harvest notices before you head out!
