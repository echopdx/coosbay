Keep your cooked crab refrigerated until ready to eat and follow these easy steps we found on the <a href="http://oregondungeness.org/consumer-info/cleaning-instructions/" target="_blank">Oregon Dungeness Crab Commission&#8217;s website</a>.  Watch the below video for more tips.

  * To remove the back, hold base of crab with one hand, place thumb under shell at mid-point, and pull off the shell.
  * The leaf-like gills are now exposed. Gently scrape them away with thumb or spoon edge.
  * Wash away the “crab butter” (viscera) under a heavy stream of cold water.



Oregon Dungeness crab is best when served warm, straight from the shell and dipped in drawn butter or seafood cocktail sauce. It also goes well with pasta, in casseroles and in seafood-based soups. Picked meat can be served chilled, Crab Louis or cocktail style as a delicious appetizer. <a href="http://oregondungeness.org/crab-recipes/" target="_blank">Click here</a> for some great recipes you can make with your fresh crab meat which include Soups & Appetizers, Sandwiches, Salads and Main Dishes.
