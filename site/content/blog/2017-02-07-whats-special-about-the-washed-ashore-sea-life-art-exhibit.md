Did you know that one of the most powerful and captivating community-driven art projects in our region is just a short day trip away in nearby Bandon, Oregon? The <a href="http://washedashore.org/" target="_blank">Washed Ashore: Art to Save the Sea</a>, led by artist Angela Haseltine Pozzi, raises awareness about the problem of plastic pollution in Earth’s oceans. 

Since it began in 2010, more than 10,000 volunteers have collected 38,000 pounds of plastic trash from more than 300 miles of beaches in our region. Rather than filling our landfills with the plastic waste, Washed Ashore volunteers transform it into something worthwhile: beautiful sculptures of marine creatures that are harmed by plastic pollution.

Washed Ashore is receiving much deserved wide-spread praise and has caught the attention of major news organizations such as _<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/02/arts/washed-ashore-plastic" target="_blank">CNN</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNEJhPj_yUY" target="_blank">PBS Newshour</a>_ and _<a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/theres-bunch-animals-zoo-summer-made-out-ocean-garbage-180959303/?no-ist" target="_blank">Smithsonian Magazine</a>_ just to name a few.

We could tell you more, but we&#8217;d rather show you.



Here are some pictures of Washed Ashore&#8217;s exhibits from their Facebook page:
