Dancer's online travel series, ExplOregon, was back in the Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area last month to help Oregon travelers discover even more adventures, interesting people and amazing local food. ExplOregon is a unique series that uses live Facebook streams and real-time updates to take audiences on an interactive journey into different regions in our state. town and city Dancer explores through real-time updates and publication. Watch this recap of ExplOregon's latest venture into Oregon's Adventure Coast. >>>>

Rick Dancer has built a captive audience while traveling across our state and sharing his experiences on Facebook Live but he has a long history in local media. In 1985, he worked as a news anchor and reporter for KCBY TV and later moved to Eugene to be the main anchor for KEZI, which he did for 20 years. He also produces his own show, “Get Real with Rick Dancer.”

“Rick has an amazing audience who follow him and his segments,” said Coos Bay-North Bend Visitor and Convention Bureau Director, Janice Langlinais in this recent article. “We are going to reach people who have probably never heard of Coos Bay or have never thought of coming to Coos Bay as a vacation destination. It helps us spread the word on how wonderful it is here.”
