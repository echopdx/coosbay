It was in November 1925 that the Egyptian Theatre opened and to mark that occasion, and mindful of the &#8220;Roaring &#8217;20s,&#8221; the ETPA will hold celebration festivities that will begin on Thursday, with a dinner at <a href="http://benettis.com/" target="_blank">Benetti&#8217;s Restaurant</a> in downtown Coos Bay, across from the theatre. The evening will begin at 5:30 p.m., with hors d’oeuvres and a no-host bar. A delicious dinner will be served at 6:30 p.m. Dressing in &#8220;Roaring &#8217;20s&#8221; style is encouraged, though optional. Tickets for the dinner are $60 and can be purchase in advance at either the Egyptian or Benetti&#8217;s. Purchasing a dinner ticket also gets you a ticket to attend _The Great Gatsby_ showing of your choice.

On Friday and Saturday evenings, Nov. 13-14, the Robert Redford version of The Great Gatsby movie will be presented both evenings starting at 7 p.m. Movie tickets for those not attending the dinner will be $10. Come experience T_he Great Gatsby_ shown on the Egyptian&#8217;s brand spanking new high definition digital projector! Also hear our <a href="http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com/wurlitzer-orchesta/" target="_blank">Mighty Wurlitzer</a> (the only one still operating in its original location in the State of Oregon) in concert before the movie showing.

The celebration will continue on Sunday, Nov. 15, when a special program is scheduled at 2 p.m. The program will feature a presentation by local historian Lionel Youst, along with the showing of a short film from 1929, highlighting Coos Bay’s finest features. At the end of this event we will sing a rousing version of Happy Birthday accompanied by our Wurlitzer organ and unveil and serve a very special birthday cake prepared for us by Chef Frank and his North Bend high school culinary students. All are invited to attend this Sunday special event (no charge) to kick off the Egyptian Theatre&#8217;s second 90 years as the Coos Bay Area&#8217;s Community Theatre!
