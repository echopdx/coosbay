## See what Oregon’s Adventure Coast has to offer this gift giving this season.

There&#8217;s no rule that says you have to wait until &#8220;Black Friday&#8221; to find great deals on amazing holiday gifts. There are a bounty of holiday treasures waiting to be discovered right now in locally owned shops throughout Oregon&#8217;s South Coast.

We&#8217;re not talking about your run of the mill beach souvenir shops. Oregon Coast visitors will enjoy a unique gift shopping experience in the eclectic shopping districts throughout downtown Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston.

With so many extraordinary retail shops opening every season, there something that can be found for everyone on your holiday list (including yourself).  We asked some locals about their favorite places to go holiday shopping, so we thought we&#8217;d share these recommendations with you.  **Be sure to visit our <a href="http://www.oregonsadventurecoast.com/activities/category/shopping/" target="_blank">Shopping Guide</a> to see a list of all of our local merchants.**
