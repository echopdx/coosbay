The fervor for sand riding is growing in popularity every year, with countless enthusiasts making the trek out to some of the world&#8217;s biggest dunes in search of adventure. The thing is, when talking about sand riding it&#8217;s possible to mean two very different activities: **sand duning** and **sand boarding.  **Though they may have their own take on what it means to ride down a sand dune, both are an undeniable blast.

Below you&#8217;ll find tips for both sand duning and sand boarding to ensure your safety, thus allowing you to have a great time! But first, let&#8217;s explain what each activity consists of, shall we?

### What is Sand Duning?

Sand Duning is the activity comprised of riding a recreational vehicle throughout Sand Dunes.

### What is Sandboarding?

Sandboarding is very similar to snowboarding, only it takes place on sand dunes instead of a snowy mountainside.

Clear on the differences? Great! Now we can get to the fun part, tips and tricks! Let&#8217;s start with Sand Duning, as seen in this video from OregonDuner.



### Tips for Sand Duning

**1. Wear a Helmet**
  
When you&#8217;re riding at high speeds on dunes there&#8217;s always the very real possibility of crashing out. Wearing a helmet is a must to keep yourself safe.

**2. Stick to Paths and Trails**
  
Be sure to stick to paths and trails as you&#8217;re making your way to the sand dunes. It&#8217;s not only safer, you&#8217;re less likely to get lost!

**3. Obey The Speed Limit**
  
As you&#8217;re driving through paths and trails, it&#8217;s crucial to stick to the speed limit. People may be using the other national park areas and will be in danger if you&#8217;re driving recklessly.

**4. Don&#8217;t Go Alone**
  
Sand Duning&#8217;s not just more fun with friends, but it&#8217;s safer too! Minimize your risk by bringing some buddies along.

**5. No Drugs, No Alcohol**
  
Just because you&#8217;re off road doesn&#8217;t mean these rules don&#8217;t apply.

**6. Avoid Wearing Headphones**
  
If you keep your hearing free of obstruction, you can steer clear of any dangerous situations that may arise. You&#8217;ll also be alert to anyone else who may be in trouble.

**7. Be Prepared Ahead of Time**
  
Check the weather forecast for day you&#8217;re heading out the dunes; nothing can ruin your fun as much as getting stuck in wet sand. While you&#8217;re at it, be sure to get a map of the area you&#8217;re planning to visit to avoid getting lost. Lastly, a first aid kit always comes in handy, though we hope you never need it!

Ready to hit the dunes? You&#8217;ll be needing a Dune Buggy or ATV first! Luckily, <a href="http://ridetheoregondunes.com/" target="_blank">Spinreel Dune Buggy and ATV Rental</a> has everything you&#8217;d need to head out for a day of sand duning!

Of course, riding sand dunes isn&#8217;t limited to four wheels!  Ask any sandboarder and they&#8217;ll tell you that the most fun you can have on a dune takes place on a board.

### Sandboarding Tips

**1. Head to the Middle**
  
You may ask &#8220;middle of what&#8221;? We mean to the middle of the dunes, away from grass and trees. Boarding by grass can damage it, which in turn can have negative effects on the sand dunes themselves.

**2. Dry Sand Good, Wet Sand Bad**
  
So here&#8217;s the thing about wet sand. It sticks to your board, which could lead to a wipe out. Stick to dry sand and you&#8217;ll be in good shape.

**3. Wear a Snowboard Helmet**
  
Sure, the dunes you&#8217;ll be boarding down are made up of soft sand, but there&#8217;s always the chance to hit a hard surface. Wear a helmet and keep yourself safe!

**4. Wear Sunscreen**
  
You&#8217;ll be in the sun for a while so you&#8217;ll certainly be needing sunscreen.

**5. Expect the Same as Snowboarding&#8230; But Different**
  
If you&#8217;re a snowboarder, then chances are you&#8217;ll pick up sandboarding very quickly. Just don&#8217;t expect it to be exactly the same as snowboarding. Take a moment when you&#8217;re starting out to get a feel for the difference between sand and snow.

So there you have it, all that&#8217;s left  is to find some dunes to practice is on. And with <a href="http://www.stateparks.com/oregon_dunes.html" target="_blank">Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area</a> just a short drive away, you&#8217;ll be riding the sand in no time!
