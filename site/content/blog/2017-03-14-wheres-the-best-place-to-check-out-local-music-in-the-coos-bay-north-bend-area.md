  With a thriving and growing restaurant and arts scene, it’s natural for our
  eclectic music culture to grow as well. The Coos Bay/North Bend region already
  hosts a fantastic selection of fun annual festivals featuring a range of
  musical genres (i.e. Oregon Coast Music Festival, Music on the Bay, BBQ, Blues
  and Brews by the Bay and many more), so we’re happy to see that our local
  music scene continues to grow as well.

With a thriving and growing restaurant and arts scene, it’s natural for our eclectic music culture to grow as well. The Coos Bay/North Bend region already hosts a fantastic selection of fun annual festivals featuring a range of musical genres (i.e. <a href="http://www.oregoncoastmusic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oregon Coast Music Festival</a>, <a href="http://musiconthebayoregon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Music on the Bay</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BbqBluesBrewsOnTheBay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBQ, Blues and Brews by the Bay</a> and many more), so we’re happy to see that our local music scene continues to grow as well.

Our area boasts several fabulous entertainment venues like <a href="http://www.thelibertytheater.org/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Liberty Theatre</a> (home of Little Theatre by the Bay), the beautifully restored historic <a href="http://egyptiantheatreoregon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Egyptian Theatre</a> where visitors can frequently find great local music and entertainment options, but it’s inside our rustic beloved local pub where one can find a treasure trove of hidden musical gems!

We asked around and here’s what some of our friends say are the best local places to support up and coming bands and musicians.
