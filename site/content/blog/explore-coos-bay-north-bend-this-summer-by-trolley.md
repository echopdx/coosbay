The Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston area has always been a relatively easy destination for locals and visitors will to get around in by car and/or bicycle; and when the Coos County Area Transit System (CCAT) introduces itâ€™s brand new trolley service in July, it will be easier!

For a $1 per ride, passengers can board the fun CCAT- Trolley and be transported to and from Downtown Coos Bay and Downtown North Bend. The trolley is expected to run all day every 30 minutes transporting riders to various landmarks along Highway 101 including The Mill Hotel-Casino, North Bend Lanes and Little Theater on the Bay, Coos History Museum, and 4th Street and Central Avenue in downtown Coos Bay.

"My hope is that this bus trolley will attract people both locally and that live away from here," CCAT General manager Sergio Gamin told the World Newspaper last month. "The route, we hope, is going to go primarily along 101 and is going to shuttle people--quickly--between Coos Bay and North Bend."

Funding for the trolley bus was made possible through Oregon Department of Transportation grants, the City of Coos Bay, and internal CCAT state and local funds and seats 21 people without the two ADA spots deployed. There is also room to stand, and hold on to the leather hand straps on the sides.

The new trolley was featured back in May on ExplOregon The Back Stories.
