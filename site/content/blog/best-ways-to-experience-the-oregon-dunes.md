There's lots to love about Oregon's Adventure Coast, but some would say that the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, the largest expanse of coastal dunes in North America, is what truly sets us apart from other travel destinations.

Whether you are seeking an off-roading adventure on a quad or ATV, a good hike, natural photo opportunities, camping, or simply seeking some peace and quiet- you will find it somewhere in the 32,186 acres of dunes, forest, streams and lakes.

“Just the massiveness of this area is worth the stop,” says a visitor on TripAdvisor. “Just going there to sit in the sand and reflect on the beauty and the music that the ocean offers. The sunsets are breathtaking and it just gives you a chance to get away from all the hustle, noise, devices and crazy that our current lives offer. What an experience.”

The Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area is one of the most awe-inspiring landscapes in the state, so visitors have a responsibility to take special care when visiting. Before setting out, make sure you have purchased any necessary Forest Service recreation passes. Whatever your adventure entails, from hiking to sandboarding, follow Leave No Trace principles, including packing in and out, leaving what you find where it’s at, and respecting wildlife and other visitors. During snowy plover nesting season, from March 15 to September 15, check for seasonal restrictions on activities at select beaches; by carefully observing the restrictions and sharing the beach, you’re helping protect these threatened birds. If you want to help preserve the Oregon Dunes, you can learn more about volunteer opportunities at SaveOregonDunes.org and the Forest Service’s volunteer page.
