## **Beachcombing and Tidepooling Tips**

Consider these tips below to stay safe and make the most of your coastline expeditions.

### **1.  Check the Tides Charts**

When beachcombing and tidepooling it&#8217;s crucial to make sure the tide is out during the time you&#8217;ll be on the beach.

<a href="http://or.usharbors.com/monthly-tides/Oregon-South%20Coast/Coos%20Bay" target="_blank">Here&#8217;s</a> an easy to use tide chart for the Coos Bay area.

### **2.  Wear Shoes/Boots with Grip**

Just because it&#8217;s the beach does not mean there will be any shortage of sharp surfaces and potentially harmful objects. Bring shoes with grip to ensure you&#8217;ll keep your footing and won&#8217;t hurt yourself.

### **3.  Watch Where You Step**

This tip goes hand in hand with the previous one. When the tide goes out it&#8217;s likely to leave behind slick, **slick** seaweed. Stepping on it can result in a vicious fall and potential serious injury. Tread heavy and carefully.

### **4.  Do Not Remove Attached Animals**

Though the temptation may be to grab a critter you see, keep in mind that doing so can bring damage to the organism and even ecosystem as a whole. Think of it in safari terms: pictures okay, grabbing not okay.

### **5.  Don&#8217;t Leave Rocks Overturned**

Similarly, rocks provide a crucial part of the ecosystem of many of the organisms you&#8217;ll see when tidepooling. By leaving rocks overturned you can negatively influence the ecosystem and disrupt different species.

### **6. Leave it Better Than You Found it**

This one is a good philosophy for life but goes double when dealing with beaches. Bring a bag with you to pick up after your own trash and if you&#8217;re so inclined to pick up any stray pieces of garbage you come across. Not only are you doing your part to help the environment but you&#8217;re also beautifying the area for other visitors.

### 7. Bring a Camera

You&#8217;ll be seeing some beautiful sights along these beach spots, we strongly recommend taking some pictures as you do so.

## **Picnicking Tips**

Most of the previous rules also apply here, but we wanted to add a few ones specific to picnics.

### 1. Consider some options for shade

Sitting out in the sun for a long duration can leave you pretty burned and a little worse for wear. Considering bring a parasol or sitting in the shade while you eat.

### 2. Bring as much finger food as possible

Avoid having to bring too many plates and knives and forks by packing food you can eat with your hands.

### 3. Sand in food is bad, bring a blanket

Consider bringing a blanket with you to lay on the sand while you eat.
