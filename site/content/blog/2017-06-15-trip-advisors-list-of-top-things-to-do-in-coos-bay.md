### What Coos Bay Attractions Are The Most Popular Among TripAdvisor Users?

The [Coos Bay](/towns/coos-bay/), [North Bend](/towns/north-bend/) and [Charleston](/towns/charleston/) area is known as Oregon’s Adventure Coast for good reason!

Each community has it&#8217;s own unique flavor and amenities with the Pacific Ocean and the Coos Bay waterways as it&#8217;s backdrop. When exploring Coos Bay, visitors are treated to fantastic local restaurants, gourmet coffee houses, museums, [antique shops](/my-oregon-coast-adventure-antiquing-in-coos-bay-oregon/), gift shops and much more.

There&#8217;s far too much to do in our area to list in just one blog post, but we would like to highlight a few of the local attractions that visitors to our area recommend the most on the popular travel site, [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g51813-Activities-Coos_Bay_Oregon.html). Even though some  of the attractions listed are located in North Bend & Charleston, this list will give you an idea of the places and spaces that visitors seem to love the most in the Coos Bay area:

### #1 State Parks

With it&#8217;s majestic views, easy accessibility and variety of available activities, it&#8217;s no surprise that Shore Acres State Park & Cape Arago State Park are the most recommended local attraction.

### #2 Cranberry Sweets

When it comes to satisfying your &#8220;sweet tooth&#8221;, there&#8217;s no place quite like Cranberry Sweets, a candy manufacturer/retailer with stores in Bandon and Coos Bay, Oregon. It’s a favorite among locals and visitors, so it&#8217;s no surprise to see them on TripAdvisor&#8217;s list. Visitors to their store are often rewarded with a variety of irresistible in store samples.

### #3 McCullough Memorial Bridge

This one surprised us a bit because we haven&#8217;t considered the bridge to be an activity. However, it turns out visitors love this local landmark band never seem to tire of traveling over it as they enter &#8220;Oregon&#8217;s Adventure Coast&#8221;.

### #4 Coos Bay Boardwalk

Visitors and locals will often take a stroll on this beautiful downtown destination as they overlook the Coos Bay waterway. Since Coos Bay is the deepest working port between Seattle and San Francisco, it&#8217;s not uncommon to see cargo ships along with fishermen, kayakers and windsurfers among other things.
