Janice,

I have added a MouseText shortcode to the styling navigation at the bottom of the editing tool. You can easily change the size of the text when you insert the shortcode. 

However, I can set the default for you, so you don't have to guess. I have provided a number of sizes below for you (with normal text in between) so you can choose the default size you would like. Let me know.
