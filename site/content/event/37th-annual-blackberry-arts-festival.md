The annual **Blackberry Arts Festival** celebrates the delicious blackberry! Blackberry arts, food and drink are the fare at this popular event in downtown Coos Bay. Featuring live music with the Blackberry Jam all weekend long! Bring the whole family to downtown Coos Bay for the Blackberry Arts Festival, August 24 and 25 2019.

The Coos Watershed Association, Coos Art Museum, Coos Bay Downtown Association, City of Coos Bay, and local artists are teaming up this summer to create seven new storm drain murals in the Coos Bay downtown area. With funding provided by the Coquille Tribal Community Fund and The Coos Art Museum, this project aims to bring awareness to the issue of stormwater runoff entering our creeks and bay, while bringing more public art into the downtown area. Murals will be in a loop, which will become a **"mural walk,"** and will be painted by local artists before and during the Blackberry Arts Festival.

The third annual **“It’s All Berry Good” Blackberry Recipe Contest** will be held on Sunday. Recipes featuring blackberries will be accepted from 9am to 11am at the Coos Bay Elks #1160 located on Central Avenue. Judging will begin at noon and the winners will be announced at 2:30pm For more information call 541-266-9706.
